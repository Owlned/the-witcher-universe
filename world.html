						Temeria is one of the northern kingdoms, lying south of the Pontar river. Its neighbors are

						After the first and second wars, Temeria profited the most out of the defeat of Nilfgaard,
						expanding its borders as far south as Angren and Riverdell, reaching the Amell mountains. But
						the Kingdom also received a heavy blow regarding its economy, which forced it to buy goods from
						their southern neighbor.

						nominally an independent state, but was actually ruled by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard.

					<p class="kingdom-name">Ebbing</p>
					<p>
						Ebbing is one of the largest states dependent on the Nilfgaardian Empire, though officially
						operates as an autonomous and self-governing kingdom. Situated at the junction of rivers and
						bordering the Great Sea, it is known for its marshes and swamps.
						Throughout the ages, most of the Nordling cartographers considered Ebbing as the southernmost
						part of the Continent, claiming that Gemmera and lands further south belong to another landmass.

					<p>
						Gemmera or Gemmeria was a former kingdom and later one of the provinces in the Nilfgaardian
						Empire. It was known for its fierce warriors, like Gemmerian Pacifiers.
						Through ages, some Nordling cartographers claimed that Gemmera was the southernmost part of the
						Continent and that the lands below belonged to another landmass, but most of the others
						considered Ebbing to be the southern boundary. By the time of the Northern War II however these
						beliefs were apparently abandoned.

					<p>
						The Nilfgaardian Empire is the most powerful empire in

						both a thriving economy and a strong, well-trained army with talented commanders. It has
						expanded mostly through the conquest of foreign countries, which were then turned into provinces
						of the Empire. The Empire's inhabitants believe that "real" Nilfgaardians are only those born in
						the heart of the Empire, and not those born in the conquered provinces.
