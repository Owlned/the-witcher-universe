					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the
						School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer,
						considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's
						adoptive father.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant
						witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens
						which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than
						his fellow witchers.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the
						witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of
						Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were
						encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt
						chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly
						and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more
						practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more
						authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on
						the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him. He, therefore,
						became a true knight.

						capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom
						she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and
						keep her from harm.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though she was nearly a century old.
						Yennefer had locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume,
						falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in
						shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet
						penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed
						wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and
						slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hung a
						black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded
						in it.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						Yennefer had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and
						emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes she wasn't
						tall, was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs.

						She always dressed in black and white, at times wore stockings, wore frilled panties but never
						wore trivialities with underwire, she didn't need to. Her voice was resonant and mildly
						derisive. Her overall feminine shape was one of a twenty-year-old girl and she moved with a
						natural, unforced grace. She was a quarter-elf (meaning she had a quarter elven blood, in her
						case on her mother's side).

						Ciri was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year and initially, Calanthe ordered

						Mousesack was ready to go, as nobody simply refused the queen, but when he was summoned a short
						time later Calanthe retracted the order without explanation.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						Growing up, not much is known about Ciri's relationship with her parents, though it appeared
						Pavetta adored her daughter, with others remarking how it was rare for her to be parted from
						Ciri. However, this didn't stop Pavetta from secretly sending Ciri ashore just as the small
						family was set to sail out from Skellige to Cintra, against Calanthe's wishes, who wished for
						them all to stay. Shortly after, Pavetta and Duny died at sea around the Sedna Abyss, making
						Ciri an orphan before she was 5 years old.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						With the death of her mother, Ciri was now the only remaining heir to Cintra and thus Calanthe
						took special care to raise her granddaughter. Despite Calanthe's attempts to keep Ciri shielded
						from learning about being a Child of Surprise and that she was destined to be a witcher since
						birth, Ciri's nanny told the young girl all about a white-haired witcher, and that he'd one day
						come for her to be taken away to be trained as one as well.

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						Not much is known about Dandelion's family except that he was of noble birth and was a cousin of
						Ferrant de Lettenhove, the royal instigator of Kerack.

						He received his early education in a temple school, where, according to Geralt, literacy was
						"beaten into him with a cane". However, he didn't truly get into poetry until he was 19, after
						being inspired by his love for Countess de Stael.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						Dandelion studied the seven liberal arts for four years at Oxenfurt University before later
						becoming a professor, but only taught students for a year before leaving the academy to travel
						the world. He would, however, visit Oxenfurt from time to time to give guest lectures.

						Within a very few years he gained worldwide fame and became known as one of the best minstrels
						in the Northern Kingdoms, with his best known song was the Ballad of the Lion Cub of Cintra.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						Dandelion first met Geralt at a fÃªte in the town of Gulet in Aedirn. There, the poet had knocked
						up a girl under the musician's podium, and her four sturdy brothers were looking for him all
						over town, threatening to geld him and cover him in pitch and sawdust.

						The so called Valley of Flowers seemed just right the right location for the duo's swift escape,
						as it was supposed to be the edge of the inhabited world, the last outpost of civilization. It
						was in the small town of Upper Posada, located in a part of the Northern Realms that later
						became Dol Blathanna, that the pair had their first adventure together, involving a nasty Sylvan
						and an encounter with Dol Blathanna's native inhabitants, the Elves. During this adventure,
						Dandelion received his priceless lute from Toruviel.

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with
						the latter. Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister
						to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes
						at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.

						She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on
						herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage,
						certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						Not much is known about Triss' upbringing. Not even a precise time of her birth, which is a
						subject to some degree of confusion - see below. What is known is the fact, that she was born
						and lived as a child in Maribor. Sometime during her childhood, she had a conduit moment and was
						noticed by sorcerers. Thus, she found her way to Aretuza. Here, she became a sorceress on her
						own, specializing in making of magical potions, mainly healing ones. This was rather amusing
						twist of fate as she herself was allergic to magical potions and could only tolerate non magical
						ones.
					</p>

					<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
						Some time later, Triss found out about her friend's on and off relations with Geralt of Rivia.
						Curious about the nature of that relationship, she used a magic and seduced the witcher,
						resulting in them spending time together in Kaer Morhen as lovers. During those time, Triss
						became very good friend with some of the other witchers, Vesemir and Eskel. Since then, she was
						always welcome in the
						witcher's keep.

						After some time however, the spell faded and Geralt simply ended the relationship. This proved
						to be a very difficult for Triss as she fell in deep love with Geralt. Despite that, the two of
						them remained very good friends in years to come and even though Triss was still unhappily in
						love with him, he did not wish to start anew.

							The Empire of Nilfgaard attacks the Kingdom of Cintra. Queen Calanthe commits suicide and
							her
							granddaughter, Cirilla manages to flee from
							the burning capital city. Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard, sends his spies to find
							her.
							He knows that this young girl has great importance, not only because of her royal blood, but
							also because of her magical potential and elven blood in her veins. <br>
							<br>
							The girl is being protected by Geralt of Rivia, a witcher - a magically and genetically
							mutated
							monster slayer for hire, who takes her to the witchers' keep - Kaer Morhen. There, Ciri is
							being
							taught by the other witchers, including old Vesemir, CoÃ«n, Eskel and Lambert. She learns
							about monsters and how to fight them. She is taught to fight with a sword in the witcher
							style. But during her "education", the sorceress Triss Merigold comes to Kaer Morhen. She is
							called by Geralt to help with occasional strange and abnormal behavior he has seen in Ciri.
							Triss realises that Ciri is a Source. She acknowledges that she does not have the power to
							control Ciri's talent, and advises Geralt to swallow his pride and seek help with Yennefer,
							a more experienced sorceress and his former lover.<br>
							<br>
							At the same time, a mysterious wizard called Rience is looking for the girl. He is a servant
							of a more powerful mage, who remains unknown. He captures Geralt's friend, Dandelion the
							bard,
							and tortures him for information about Ciri.Dandelion is saved by the timely arrival of
							Yennefer, who engages in a short magic combat with Rience. Rience manages to escape through
							a portal opened by his master, but left with a prominent facial scar from Yennefer's
							spell.<br>
							<br>
							In the spring, Geralt leaves Kaer Morhen with Triss and Ciri, intending to deliver Ciri to
							the Temple School in Ellander where she would receive a "normal" education from Nenneke.
							Geralt does his best to track Rience and his mysterious employer. With the help
							of Dandelion and Shani, he forces a confrontation with Rience, during which both are
							injured. Rience's master intervenes again, opening a portal for him, and Geralt is prevented
							from pursuing the mage by Philippa Eilhart, who also kills the last surviving of the
							Michelet brothers so as not to provide Geralt any source of information which might
							eventually reveal the mysterious mage. Eilhart then leaves behind a wounded Geralt.

						<br>
						Time of Contempt was written by Andrzej Sapkowski, first published in Poland in 1995 by
						SUPERNOWA,
						and is the fourth book in The Witcher series and the second novel in the saga. It directly
						continues on from Blood of Elves, which begins the saga of Ciri and Geralt. Summary of the
						book:<br>
					</p>

					<div class="scrollable-card scrollbar-card scrollbar-style">
						<p class="section-paragraph card-text-alignments">
							The story begins where Blood of Elves left off, essentially with Ciri and Yennefer having
							just left the Temple in Ellander, on their way to Gors Velen, and ultimately Thanedd Island.
							It is Yennefer's intention that Ciri be enrolled at Aretuza and that she continue her
							instruction in the use and mastery of magic.<br>
							<br>
							Once they arrive in Gors Velen, Yennefer goes to see her old friend Giancardi Molnar, a
							dwarven banker. The latter informs the sorceress that her financial movements are being
							tracked, something Yennefer already suspected, but he arranges an essentially unlimited line
							of credit for her and makes several financial transfers to cover expenses for Ciri's
							education.<br>
							<br>
							Geralt meets Vilgefortz for
							the first time. The mage is considered very young, he is also considered to be particularly
							talented, but as Geralt finds out, his road to becoming a mage was not exactly the usual
							route. The wizard was abandoned as a baby and taken in and raised by druids.<br>
							<br>
							Geralt escapes from Dijkstra and rushes in to save Yennefer and Ciri at the school. In the
							ensuring chaos Yennefer and Geralt fight the invading scoi'tael supporting Vilgefortz, while
							Ciri flees from the scene. The Black Rider plaguing Ciri's dreams turns out to be a
							Nilfgaardian soldier that tried to escort Ciri out of Cintra to safety. Geralt finally faces
							Vilgefortz, who makes him an offer to join him to his side under Emperor Emhyr var Emreis.
							Geralt refuses and a fight ensues in which Geralt is soundly defeated. Tissaia finally
							realizes her mistake and along with Triss Merigold's help, takes Geralt to safety.<br>
							<br>
							Ciri escapes via a portal in Tor Lara, also known as the Gulls' Tower, during Geralt's fight
							with Vilgefortz. She awakens in Korath desert known to many as the 'frying pan' and barely
							manages to stay alive, thanks to the help of a unicorn, whom she names "Little Horse". When
							pushed for survival, she relies on her magical abilities involving fire, which invokes more
							nightmares and hallucinations that forcefully entices her to take revenge on those who
							abandoned her, which leaves her scarred and promising herself to avoid fire as a source of
							power.<br>
							<br>
							After escaping the desert, she is captured by bounty hunters of Nilfgaard and manages to
							escape from them with the help of bandits known as the Rats. She feels safe and gains a
							sense of belonging among the group as the members faced a similar harsh reality of being
							abandoned during the times of contempt. Through her skills she learned in Kaer Morhen she
							impresses the group, which gains her the name Falka.

							While recovering in Brokilon from his injuries sustained during the Thanedd coup, Geralt
							meets Milva, a hunter and expert archer. Her mastery of the bow is unequalled. Despite not
							particularly liking the convalescing witcher, she decides to follow Geralt, who is
							accompanied by Dandelion, on his way towards Nilfgaard and hopefully, Ciri. The journey is
							not easy, the war is encroaching seemingly from all directions and nearly every city is

							At several points in their journey, Geralt and his companions come across Cahir, the
							erstwhile "Black Rider" that plagued Ciri's dreams. Initially, the knight is being
							transported as a prisoner by some hawkers, when Geralt spares his life for the second time.
							However, the witcher wants nothing to do with the young Nilfgaardian and leaves him to his
							own devices, Cahir is ever persistent and continues to shadow the witcher and his entourage.
							Eventually, through Milva's intervention, the young knight comes to join the group.<br>

							Finally, the troupe is joined by Regis, a vampire, some might say "monster", who rather
							surprisingly becomes the monster hunter's good friend. Regis proves invaluable for his

							As the group travels east, they are inevitably caught between the warring factions which
